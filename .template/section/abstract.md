This document provides an overview of the TEMPLATE reference formulation and its
natural RDF mappings. 
The TEMPLATE reference formulation describes how to access and reference data within
TEMPLATE data sources using TEMPLATE. 
The natural RDF mappings define the process of converting TEMPLATE data types into
their corresponding datatyped RDF literals, ensuring compatibility and
interoperability with RDF standards.
