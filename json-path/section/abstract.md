This document provides an overview of the JSONPath reference formulation and its natural RDF mappings. The JSONPath reference formulation describes how to access and reference data within JSON data sources using JSONPath. The natural RDF mappings define the process of converting native JSON data types into their corresponding RDF literals, ensuring compatibility and interoperability with RDF standards.
