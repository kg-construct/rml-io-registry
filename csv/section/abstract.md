This document provides an overview of the CSV reference formulation and its natural RDF mappings. The CSV reference formulation describes how to access and reference data within CSV data sources by column name. The natural RDF mappings define the process of converting CSV data types into their corresponding datatyped RDF literals, ensuring compatibility and interoperability with RDF standards.
