# Abstract

This document provides an overview of the CSVW reference formulation, 
the vocabulary used to define it, and its natural RDF mappings. 
The CSVW reference formulation utilizes CSVW metadata
to describes how to access and reference data within CSV data sources. 
The natural RDF mappings define the process of converting CSV data types 
into their corresponding RDF literals, 
ensuring compatibility and interoperability with RDF standards.
